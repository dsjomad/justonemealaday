Alrighty.
It's been a while since I've done a coffee and water fast.  I'm starting tomorrow.
Having a glass of whiskey right now. I'm indulging because I plan to have only coffee and water tomorrow.
I'm going to take this one day at a time. 

Expect me to provide tomorrow:
1. Starting weight
2. Blood Pressure
3. Fluid intake 
4. Anything else that I can think of that needs to be documented.

Good night!
