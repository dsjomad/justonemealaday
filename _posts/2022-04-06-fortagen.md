I was sick yesterday so I'm finally starting my fast today.
For me, getting into the fasting state is always the most difficult the first 2 days.
If I find myself getting hungry I may resort to taking some [Fortagen](www.fortagen.com)

According to their website, Fortagen is

"5X More Efficient Than Standard Protein Sources
One serving (10g) of Fortagen provides as much usable vegan protein for muscle building 
as 50g of ordinary protein from other sources such as whey protein. 
And with just 4 calories per serving, it's the best protein to use when intermittent fasting."

I have taken it before when I am doing a water coffee fast when I have been concerned about losing muscle mass.
I'll update this page with a synopsis at the end of the day.

UPDATE: 7pm CST

I took 2 servings of Fortagen at dinner time because I was feeling hungry.
