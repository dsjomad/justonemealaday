So, needless to say, my attempt in April with my water/coffee fast was not a success.
I am on my 7th day of fasting in May 2022.
My weight on Monday, May 15th was 233.6

Monday wasn't too hard. I struggled a little. It's a mind game the first couple of days.
Tried to stay preoccupied with work and envisioning a healthier me.

My daughter is gettin married in June and I need to be able to fit in my suit (or need to buy a new one if I lose too much weight ;)

Anyway, I wanted to check in quickly.

FYI : My days last week consisted of the following:

Wake up 6am: Enjoy 2 cups of black coffee.
Spend quality time communicating with my spouse for an hour: 7am - 8am
8am to 5pm: Work from home
5pm - 9pm: Family time

Drink lots of water!

Try to sleep. Fasting seems to keep me awake.
